        <h2>In loving memory of Grayson</h2>
        <p>Friends, family, and loved ones,
           please join us as we say goodbye 
           to our dearest Grayson.
            We’ll pay tribute to his life 
            and many accomplishments at the
             Veterans Center at 11:30 a.m. on March 3.
              If you’d like to make a donation in his honor, 
              we suggest contributing to Wounded Warriors,
               an organization near and dear to Grayson. </p>
